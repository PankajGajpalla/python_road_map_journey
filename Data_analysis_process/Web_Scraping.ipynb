They tell us whether they feel respected as individuals, if they receive training benefits, appreciation, support for their well-being and opportunities to contribute. They tell us whether they believe their company is fair related to pay, profits, promotions, recognition, favoritism and opportunities. They tell us if they are proud of their work, their team, and their company and if they feel they make a difference, and their work is meaningful. And they tell us whether they enjoy the people they work with, feel cared for and can be themselves.\n",

Great Place To Work measures the differences in survey responses across demographic groups and roles within each organization to assess both the quality and consistency of the employee experience. Statements are weighted according to their relevance in describing the most important aspects of an equitable workplace.\n",

Each company also answers six essay questions that provide greater insight into how, and why the organization is great for all people. Responses are rigorously evaluated and cross-reviewed according to Great Place To Work’s research-driven criteria. From what companies share in datapoints and essays, we identify the organizations that offer the most generous, caring and innovative programs reflecting a genuine commitment to meet the diversity of their people’s needs inside and outside the workplace as validated by what employees themselves report in survey results.\n",

While essay responses provide important context for rankings, only survey data can garner a list placement. To be eligible for the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For list, employers must have 1,000 or more employees in the U.S. and cannot be a government agency. This year's list was created based on feedback from over half a million employees from eligible companies who completed employee surveys and provided company information by August 2, 2022. In total, Great Place To Work analyzed survey feedback from more than 1.3 million US employees this year.\n",

      "            Cisco really cares about its people. One example is \"a day for me\" which are days off throughout the year when Cisco shuts down to let employees recharge. We also have a company-wide shut down at the end of the year which allows the whole company time off to spend with family over the holidays. Cisco also cares about the environment, and social justice, and has a strong commitment to diversity and equality. Our ELT is very approachable and has addressed challenges head-on, they have shown strong leadership in addressing employee concerns around the many challenges we face in the world today. The culture here is really what makes Cisco a great place to work. It really is a family and people want the best for each other and the company.\n",

My direct manager and the leadership seem to really care about me as a person - they don't just check-in on my work, but about things happening in my life. Recently, when I was moving, our EC leader sent me a text on moving day saying \"Good luck with the move\". These simple gestures go a long way, and I pass it down to my team too. I feel psychologically safe coming to work and in taking calculated risks. I am extremely proud to work for Hilton and genuinely hope to have a bright career here.\n",

Deloitte proactively identifies ways to improve our experience and delight us as practitioners. For example, they revisited EVERYONE's base compensation proactively without us asking and adjusted our compensation in what felt like a fair, objective way. How many companies will raise your salary when you ASK? If they do, you're lucky...but how many will proactively analyze and adjust the fairness of your compensation BEFORE you even ask!? ONLY Deloitte. For this small reason and many others I am SO proud to work here. What an amazing employer.\n",

My husband and I are in the middle of adopting a baby and I might need to go on parental leave at any time. I was just hired by Box, and the team was excited for me! At my last job, they were concerned about when I'd need to go on leave and treated it as a negative. In addition, the compensation at Box is aligned with inflation and ahead of market trends. I received a great increase in coming to Box, and I didn't ask for it during the interview process. Most companies would penny pinch but Box gave me what they felt I deserved.\n",

These are great for networking. It's nice to see not only all of the wonderful medical benefits, but to also see that there are benefits for outside of work. This also encourages employees to maintain work life balance.\n",
